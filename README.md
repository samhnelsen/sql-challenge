# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I was asked to play the role of data engineer for Pewlett Hackard, a ficitional company, and analyze their employee data from those who were employed in the 80s and 90s.

In this repository are:
- an image of the data modeling conducted via QuickDB
- a .sql file of my schemata called sql_challenge_schemata.sql
- a .sql file of my SQL queries called sql_challenge_queries.sql
